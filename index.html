						<p>
							I’m currently enrolled in a Computer Science program at Red River College Polytechnic. 
							I’ve taken on extra coding projects to help acquire skills to work in this field. 
							Here is a brief description of what I've worked on so far outside of school.
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li id="firstBullet">
									Programmed a classic Pong game in C# using Unity, after completing a Udemy course.
							</li>
							<li id="secondBullet">
									Designed a UML for an object-oriented program and created a windows-based application in C# from it. 
								    This application’s main design is for administrators to enter and calculate wages of their employees and keep track of car sales at the dealership.
							</li>
							<li id="thirdBullet">
									As a result, my knowledge of OOP has grown. Specifically, how to conceptualize data structures and how to fully utilize collections. 
									These techniques can be applied to video game design. 
							</li>
						</ul>

								Finally, my biggest supporting asset to my career in computer programming is that I’m a journeyman electrician. 
								From my time in this role, I’ve gained over 12 years of experience in logical problem solving when it comes to troubleshooting broken electrical systems. 
								I’ve found this skill of logically breaking problems down to their base components has helped me advance within this field.
								In addition, I’m very accustomed to leading teams/working within them and taking directions from my time as a foreman in the trades.
								These teams and projects operated in a marriage of agile and waterfall environments. All these experiences have aided my journey throughout 
								the Business Information Technology program and will continue aid me in industry.
